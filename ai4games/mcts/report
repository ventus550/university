ntroduction
MCTS has seen a lot of success in the field of artificial intelligence. In this report we will be applying it to the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game on the CodingGames platform. All mentioned algorithms are implemented in Javascript. The custom build game engine is able to handle 30000 simulations per second (measured with CodingGames during the preprocessing phase). Unsurprisingly Flat MC scores pretty much the same amount of simulations while the pure MCTS finishes at around 16000 simulations per second. It’s worth mentioning that this implementation of MCTS recycles branches from the previous turns and thus it is quite common to see trees with initial sizes of around 500 simulations which should amount to just a little less than 2000 simulations per 100ms. Both algorithms were run a few dozens of times and the time limit was never exceeded thus it is rather safe to assume this to be the lower bound for the algorithms’ efficiency.
